# GMail Python Services

This is a assignment for my Computer Networks course at college, in which I'm making an application that the user can manipulate a gmail account directly through the terminal. It uses SMTP to send e-mails and IMAP to read e-mails and organize folders, you can also chose to use POP3 to read e-mails.
